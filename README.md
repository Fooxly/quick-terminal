# Terminal

Terminal is a simple extension that adds a button inside the statusbar.
When clicking this button a native terminal will be opened.

#### Where does it open?
If the file is inside a workspace the workspace folder will be used. If the file is not inside the workspace or no workspace is selected the terminal will be set to the folder the file is inside.
